# Yet Another Portal

## TODOs

- create way to get notified about "key has been released"
    - this should allow for toggle behavior (toggle wireframe, toggle camera, etc.)
- create layer system
    - layers: HUD, Game, Menus, Debug
- on windows the game breaks between commit ee392dbc45af0213003a880fb30d085a2effa73e and 28cb4e884cd462707027bce96bada96def269680
